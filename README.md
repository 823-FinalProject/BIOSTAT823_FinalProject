# BIOSTAT823 Final Project

## Prediction of Patient's Risk of Death based on Lab Test after Entering ICU

Team members: Ruqian Cheng, Mingxuan Wang and Ruiqi Zhang.

### Dataset

After comparing the 3 dataset, we finally choose the [MIMIC](https://mimic.mit.edu/). This dataset includes the unidentified health data related to approximately 60,000 ICU admitted patients (53,432 adult patients and 8,100 neonatal patients) from June 2001 to October 2012.

Outcome variable (binary):

- `flag`: alive or death.

Predictor variables:

- `Base Excess`: the amount of excess or insufficient level of bicarbonate in the system.
- `Anion Gap`: a measurement of the difference-or gap-between the negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes.
- `Chloride`: measures the amount of chloride in your blood.
- `Creatinine`: a chemical compound left over from energy-producing processes in your muscles.
- `Potassium`: measures the amount of potassium in your blood.
- `Sodium`: measures the amount of sodium in your blood.
- `Urea Nitrogen`: reveals important information about how well your kidneys are working.
- `Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)`: a measurement of the range in the volume and size of your red blood cells.
- `White Blood Cells`: measures the number of white blood cells in your body.
- `icu_los`: ICU length of stay
